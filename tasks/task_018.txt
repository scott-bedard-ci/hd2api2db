# Task ID: 18
# Title: Task #18: Rebuild Planets API Integration to Match Actual API Response Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the database schema, import scripts, and related components to correctly handle the actual structure of the planets API response, ensuring all fields are properly stored and retrieved.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive rebuild of the Planets API integration to align with the actual API response structure. The implementation should follow these steps:

1. Analyze the current Planets API response structure and identify discrepancies with our existing database schema.
2. Design an updated database schema that accurately reflects all fields in the API response.
3. Create a migration script using the drop-and-rebuild approach (as in Task #16) to safely update the schema without data loss.
4. Update the data transformer to properly handle all fields, paying special attention to:
   - Integer timestamp fields that need conversion to MySQL DATETIME strings
   - Nested objects or arrays that may require serialization
   - Field type mismatches between the API and database
5. Modify the import scripts to correctly parse and store all fields from the API response.
6. Update any related components that interact with planet data (controllers, services, etc.).
7. Revise the API documentation to reflect the changes in the data structure.
8. Ensure proper error handling for cases where the API response structure might change in the future.

The implementation should prioritize data integrity while maintaining backward compatibility with existing application features that rely on planet data.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this task should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test the data transformer to ensure it correctly converts API response objects to database entities
   - Verify timestamp conversion logic works correctly for all date/time fields
   - Test edge cases like missing fields or null values in the API response

2. Integration tests:
   - Create mock API responses that match the actual structure
   - Verify the entire import pipeline correctly processes and stores the data
   - Test the database schema by inserting sample data and checking constraints

3. Manual verification:
   - Perform a complete data import from the live Planets API
   - Verify all fields are correctly stored in the database
   - Compare a sample of raw API responses with the stored database records
   - Check that all application features using planet data continue to function correctly

4. Regression testing:
   - Ensure that existing queries and reports using planet data still work
   - Verify that any dependent services can still access the required planet information

5. Documentation validation:
   - Review updated API documentation for accuracy
   - Confirm schema diagrams match the implemented database structure

The testing should be documented with screenshots of before/after database records and API responses to demonstrate successful implementation.
