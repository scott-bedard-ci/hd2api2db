# Task ID: 22
# Title: Task #22: Rebuild War Info API Integration to Match Actual API Response Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the database schema, import scripts, and related components to correctly handle the actual structure of the war info API response, ensuring all fields are properly stored and retrieved.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive rebuild of the War Info API integration to align with the actual API response structure. The implementation should follow these steps:

1. Analyze the actual War Info API response structure to identify all fields, data types, and relationships.
2. Update the database schema to accommodate the actual structure:
   - Create a migration script using the drop-and-rebuild approach (reference Task #16)
   - Ensure proper field types and constraints are defined
   - Add appropriate indexes for performance optimization

3. Update the data transformer:
   - Identify and convert integer timestamp fields to MySQL DATETIME strings
   - Handle any nested objects or arrays appropriately
   - Implement proper error handling for missing or malformed fields

4. Modify the import scripts to:
   - Parse the API response correctly
   - Transform data according to the updated schema
   - Validate data before insertion
   - Log any errors or inconsistencies

5. Update related components:
   - Adjust any services or controllers that interact with war info data
   - Update data access objects or repositories
   - Modify any caching mechanisms if applicable

6. Update API documentation to reflect the new structure and field definitions.

7. Follow the established project patterns for error handling, logging, and performance considerations.

Note: Pay special attention to integer timestamp fields in the API response, as these need to be properly converted to MySQL DATETIME format in the transformer.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the successful completion of this task, implement the following testing strategy:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the data transformer to ensure proper conversion of integer timestamps to DATETIME strings
   - Verify correct handling of all fields in the API response
   - Test edge cases such as missing fields, null values, and unexpected data types

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create tests that simulate API responses with sample data
   - Verify the entire pipeline from API response to database storage
   - Test the retrieval of stored data to ensure it matches the original API response

3. Database Verification:
   - Execute the migration script in a test environment
   - Verify the schema matches the expected structure
   - Check constraints, indexes, and relationships

4. Manual Testing:
   - Perform a complete end-to-end test with real API data
   - Verify all fields are correctly stored and retrieved
   - Compare the stored data with the original API response

5. Documentation Review:
   - Ensure API documentation is updated to reflect the new structure
   - Verify code comments are clear and accurate

6. Performance Testing:
   - Measure query performance for common operations
   - Verify that large datasets can be processed efficiently

7. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure that other components dependent on war info data continue to function correctly
   - Verify that the changes don't negatively impact existing functionality
