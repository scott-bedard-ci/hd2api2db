# Task ID: 23
# Title: Add error reporting for missing Planet IDs during planet history ingestion and tests
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement logic to collect and report all missing planet_id errors (foreign key violations) encountered during planet history ingestion or testing. The report should include the missing planet IDs and relevant context for each occurrence.
# Details:
The implementation approach will involve:

1. Capturing foreign key violations during planet history ingestion
2. Collecting all missing planet_id errors in a structured format
3. Including contextual information such as timestamp, operation type, and data source
4. Generating a comprehensive error report that can be reviewed by administrators
5. Ensuring the system continues processing valid records while logging invalid ones

# Test Strategy:
Testing will include:

1. Unit tests with mock data containing known missing planet IDs
2. Integration tests verifying error collection during actual ingestion processes
3. Validation that all error contexts are properly captured
4. Verification that the error report format is clear and actionable
