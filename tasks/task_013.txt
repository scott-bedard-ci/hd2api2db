# Task ID: 13
# Title: Task #13: Implement Database Safety Check in Test Scripts
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a safety mechanism to all test scripts that verifies the database name ends with '_test' before execution, preventing accidental runs against production or staging databases.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. Create a utility function `validateTestDatabase()` that:
   - Extracts the current database name from the connection configuration
   - Verifies the database name ends with '_test' using a regex pattern
   - Throws a clear error and aborts execution if validation fails
   - Logs a confirmation message if validation passes

2. Modify all test script entry points to:
   - Call the validation function before any test setup or execution begins
   - Implement as an early check in the main test runner or in each individual test file
   - Ensure the check cannot be bypassed or disabled without explicit override

3. For test frameworks with hooks (like Jest, Mocha, pytest):
   - Implement the check in a beforeAll/beforeEach hook to ensure it runs before any tests
   - Configure the hook to have the highest priority

4. Add configuration for emergency override:
   - Create an environment variable (e.g., FORCE_TEST_ON_PROD=true) that can bypass the check
   - Require multiple confirmations if override is used
   - Log detailed warnings if override is activated

5. Update documentation:
   - Document the safety mechanism in the test README
   - Include examples of expected behavior and error messages
   - Explain the override process for exceptional situations

# Test Strategy:
To verify successful implementation:

1. Unit test the validation function:
   - Test with various database names (e.g., 'app_test', 'test_app', 'app_prod', 'app_staging')
   - Verify it correctly identifies and rejects non-test databases
   - Confirm it accepts databases with '_test' suffix

2. Integration testing:
   - Temporarily modify database connection settings to point to a non-test database
   - Run test scripts and verify they abort with appropriate error messages
   - Check that no test operations were performed on the non-test database
   - Test with the override mechanism and verify it works as expected

3. Code review verification:
   - Ensure the check is implemented in all test entry points
   - Verify the check runs before any database operations
   - Confirm error messages are clear and actionable

4. Documentation check:
   - Review updated documentation for clarity and completeness
   - Verify examples match the actual implementation

5. Regression testing:
   - Run all tests with correct test database configuration
   - Verify tests still pass and the validation doesn't interfere with normal operation
   - Measure any performance impact from the added validation
