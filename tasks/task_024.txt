# Task ID: 24
# Title: Task #24: Refactor Testing Framework to Use Pytest
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Standardize the project's testing approach by migrating from individual test scripts to pytest as the primary test runner, including proper implementation of fixtures, test discovery, and reporting mechanisms.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive refactoring of the existing test suite to leverage pytest's capabilities:

1. **Migration to pytest structure**:
   - Convert all existing test files to follow pytest naming conventions (test_*.py or *_test.py)
   - Restructure test directories to enable automatic test discovery
   - Remove any manual test runners or main() functions from test files
   - Update import statements to use relative imports where appropriate

2. **Implement pytest fixtures**:
   - Create fixtures for common setup/teardown operations
   - Develop a database fixture that properly connects to helldivers2_test database
   - Ensure database state is properly reset between tests
   - Implement session-level fixtures for expensive operations that can be reused

3. **Database connection management**:
   - Create a centralized configuration for test database credentials
   - Implement environment variable handling for database connection parameters
   - Ensure tests use isolated database connections to prevent cross-test contamination
   - Add transaction management to roll back changes after tests

4. **Test isolation and repeatability**:
   - Ensure each test can run independently
   - Implement proper cleanup mechanisms
   - Address any tests with external dependencies
   - Eliminate any test order dependencies

5. **Documentation updates**:
   - Update README with detailed instructions on running tests with pytest
   - Document any custom fixtures and their usage
   - Include examples of running specific test subsets
   - Add information about test reporting options

6. **CI/CD integration**:
   - Update any CI/CD pipelines to use pytest
   - Configure pytest to generate reports compatible with CI tools
   - Set up proper exit codes for test failures

# Test Strategy:
The refactoring will be verified through the following steps:

1. **Functionality verification**:
   - Run the complete test suite with pytest to ensure all tests pass
   - Compare test results before and after refactoring to confirm no functionality was lost
   - Verify that all tests can be discovered automatically by pytest

2. **Isolation testing**:
   - Run individual tests in isolation to verify they don't depend on other tests
   - Run tests in different orders to ensure they don't rely on execution sequence
   - Verify tests can be run in parallel without conflicts

3. **Database connection validation**:
   - Confirm tests properly connect to helldivers2_test database
   - Verify database state is properly reset between test runs
   - Test with different environment configurations to ensure connection parameters work correctly
   - Check that no test data leaks between test runs

4. **Documentation review**:
   - Verify README accurately describes how to run tests with pytest
   - Ensure all custom fixtures are properly documented
   - Confirm the documentation includes examples for common test scenarios

5. **CI/CD verification**:
   - Run the test suite in the CI/CD pipeline to confirm integration
   - Verify test reports are generated correctly
   - Ensure the pipeline fails appropriately when tests fail

6. **Code review**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of the refactored test code
   - Verify all main() functions and manual test runners have been removed
   - Confirm proper use of pytest fixtures and assertions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Deduplicate test DB setup fixtures using conftest.py [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Move the shared setup_test_db_env and clean_db_before_and_after fixtures to a single conftest.py file in src/. Remove duplicate fixture definitions from all test files and ensure all tests use the shared fixtures for DB setup and teardown. This will enforce DRY principles and simplify test maintenance.
### Details:
- Create src/conftest.py with the shared fixtures for DB environment and cleanup.
- Remove the same fixtures from all test_*.py files in src/.
- Confirm all tests still run and use the correct DB credentials and cleanup logic.

## 2. Add pytest markers for fast vs complete test runs [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add pytest markers to distinguish between fast (unit) tests and complete (including integration/orchestration) tests. Update pytest.ini and test files accordingly. Document usage in README if needed.
### Details:
- Mark the orchestration/integration test(s) with @pytest.mark.complete
- All other tests are considered 'fast' by default
- Add marker registration to pytest.ini
- Document how to run only fast tests (pytest -m fast), only complete tests (pytest -m complete), or all tests (pytest)
- Ensure the orchestration test is excluded from 'fast' runs
- Update README with new test running instructions if necessary.

## 3. Complete migration to pytest structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Finalize the migration of all test files to follow pytest conventions and ensure automatic test discovery works correctly.
### Details:
- Verify all test files follow pytest naming conventions
- Confirm test directories are properly structured
- Remove any remaining manual test runners
- Update import statements as needed
- Ensure all tests are discoverable by pytest

## 4. Finalize database connection management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Complete the implementation of centralized database configuration and connection management for tests.
### Details:
- Finalize centralized configuration for test database credentials
- Verify environment variable handling for connection parameters
- Ensure test isolation through proper connection management
- Implement transaction rollback for test cleanup

## 5. Update documentation and CI/CD integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Complete documentation updates and integrate pytest with CI/CD pipelines.
### Details:
- Finalize README updates with comprehensive test instructions
- Document all custom fixtures and their usage
- Update CI/CD pipelines to use pytest
- Configure test reporting for CI tools
- Verify proper exit code handling for test failures

## 6. Final verification and review [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform final verification of the refactored test framework and conduct a comprehensive review.
### Details:
- Run complete test suite to verify all tests pass
- Confirm test isolation and repeatability
- Verify database state management between tests
- Review all code changes for quality and consistency
- Ensure all requirements of the task have been met
