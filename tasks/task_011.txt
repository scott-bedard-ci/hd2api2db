# Task ID: 11
# Title: Task #11: Configure Test Environment with Dedicated Test Database
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update all test scripts to use a dedicated test database (helldivers2_test) instead of the production database, ensuring test isolation and data safety.
# Details:
This task involves several key implementation steps:

1. Create a dedicated test database schema (helldivers2_test) that mirrors the production database structure.
2. Modify all test scripts to use environment variables or configuration settings that point to the test database.
3. Update the configuration system (from Task #9) to include test-specific database settings.
4. Implement environment detection to automatically use the test database when in test mode.
5. Add database connection string overrides in all test files.
6. Create database setup and teardown scripts that prepare the test database before tests and clean it after tests.
7. Ensure all CI/CD pipelines are updated to use the test database configuration.
8. Document the test database setup process in the project documentation.
9. Add safeguards that prevent test code from connecting to production databases, such as hostname/database name validation.
10. Update any database fixtures or mock data generators to work with the test database.

The implementation should leverage the configuration system created in Task #9, extending it to handle different environments (development, testing, production). All database connection strings in test code should be parameterized to use MYSQL_DATABASE environment variable or equivalent configuration setting.

# Test Strategy:
To verify this task has been completed successfully:

1. Run a comprehensive test suite with database logging enabled to confirm all database connections are using the helldivers2_test database.
2. Create a test that attempts to connect to the production database and verify it fails with appropriate error messages.
3. Verify that CI/CD pipelines successfully run tests using the test database.
4. Perform code review to ensure all test files have been updated to use the test database configuration.
5. Create a script that analyzes all test files for hardcoded database names and run it to verify no production database references remain.
6. Test the database setup and teardown scripts to ensure they correctly prepare the test environment.
7. Verify that running tests does not affect production data by deliberately modifying test data and confirming production remains unchanged.
8. Test the system with various environment configurations to ensure it correctly selects the appropriate database.
9. Document test results, including logs showing database connections to the test database.
10. Perform a pair programming session where another developer reviews the changes and confirms the implementation meets requirements.
