# Task ID: 14
# Title: Task #14: Document Test Database Policy in Project Documentation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation outlining the project's test database policy, specifying that all tests must use a dedicated test database, never run with production credentials, and always clean up test data.
# Details:
This task involves creating clear documentation of the test database policy that has been implemented in recent tasks (11-13). The documentation should be added to both the README.md and a new CONTRIBUTING.md file if one doesn't exist.

For the README.md:
1. Add a section titled "Testing Policy" that briefly outlines the key requirements:
   - All tests must use the dedicated test database (helldivers2_test)
   - Tests must never run with production credentials
   - All test data must be cleaned up after test execution
   - Reference the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more details

For the CONTRIBUTING.md:
1. Create this file if it doesn't exist
2. Add a detailed "Testing Guidelines" section that includes:
   - Explanation of why these policies exist (data safety, test isolation, etc.)
   - Specific instructions on how to configure test database connections
   - Code examples showing proper setup and teardown patterns
   - Instructions for creating test credentials
   - Explanation of the safety checks implemented in Task #13
   - Clear warnings about the risks of not following these guidelines
   - Process for verifying tests are compliant with these policies

The documentation should be written in a clear, accessible style that both new and existing developers can understand. Include references to the specific implementation details from Tasks #11-13 to ensure consistency between the code and documentation.

# Test Strategy:
To verify this task has been completed successfully:

1. Review the README.md file:
   - Confirm it contains a new "Testing Policy" section
   - Verify the section clearly states the three key requirements
   - Check that it references the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more details

2. Review the CONTRIBUTING.md file:
   - Confirm it exists and contains a "Testing Guidelines" section
   - Verify it includes detailed explanations of all required policy elements
   - Check that code examples are provided and accurate
   - Ensure the documentation references the implementations from Tasks #11-13

3. Conduct a peer review:
   - Have at least two other team members review the documentation
   - Verify they understand the policies without additional explanation
   - Confirm the documentation is comprehensive enough for new developers

4. Test with a new developer:
   - If possible, have someone unfamiliar with the project read the documentation
   - Ask them to explain the testing policy back to you
   - Verify they understand all key requirements

5. Check for consistency:
   - Ensure the documentation accurately reflects the actual implementations from Tasks #11-13
   - Verify there are no contradictions between README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md

The task is complete when all documentation is in place, peer-reviewed, and accurately reflects the implemented testing policies.
