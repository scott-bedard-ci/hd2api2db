# Task ID: 19
# Title: Task #19: Rebuild Campaigns API Integration to Match Actual API Response Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the database schema, import scripts, and related components to correctly handle the actual structure of the campaigns API response, ensuring all fields are properly stored and retrieved.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive rebuild of the Campaigns API integration to align with the actual API response structure. The implementation should follow these steps:

1. Analyze the actual Campaigns API response structure to identify all fields, data types, and relationships.
2. Design an updated database schema that accurately represents this structure, ensuring proper field types and relationships.
3. Implement a drop-and-rebuild migration approach (similar to Task #16) to update the database schema without data loss concerns.
4. Update the import scripts to correctly parse and transform the API response data.
5. Pay special attention to integer timestamp fields, which should be converted to MySQL DATETIME strings in the transformer.
6. Update any related components that interact with campaign data, including services, controllers, and repositories.
7. Ensure proper error handling for API response variations or missing fields.
8. Update the API documentation to reflect the new structure and field mappings.
9. Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.
10. Update any existing unit tests to accommodate the new structure.
11. Consider performance implications, especially if the campaigns data is frequently accessed or large in volume.

# Test Strategy:
To verify successful completion of this task, implement the following testing strategy:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Create unit tests for the transformer to verify correct conversion of integer timestamps to MySQL DATETIME strings.
   - Test the import scripts with sample API responses to ensure proper parsing and storage.
   - Verify error handling for edge cases (missing fields, malformed responses).

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the complete flow from API response to database storage.
   - Verify that all fields from the API response are correctly stored in the database.
   - Test retrieval operations to ensure data integrity is maintained.

3. Migration Testing:
   - Test the migration script on a staging environment with production-like data.
   - Verify that the drop-and-rebuild approach works correctly without unexpected side effects.

4. Manual Testing:
   - Manually inspect the database schema to confirm it matches the API response structure.
   - Perform a test import with real API data and verify all fields are correctly stored.
   - Check the application's UI/features that display campaign data to ensure they work correctly with the new structure.

5. Documentation Verification:
   - Review updated documentation for accuracy and completeness.
   - Ensure API documentation reflects the actual implementation.

6. Regression Testing:
   - Verify that other system components that depend on campaign data continue to function correctly.
