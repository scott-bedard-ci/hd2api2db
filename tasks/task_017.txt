# Task ID: 17
# Title: Task #17: Rebuild War Status API Integration to Match Actual API Response Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the database schema, import scripts, and related components to correctly handle the actual structure of the war status API response, ensuring all fields are properly stored and retrieved.
# Details:
This task involves a complete rebuild of the War Status API integration to align with the actual API response structure. The implementation should:

1. Analyze the current War Status API response format to identify all fields and their data types.
2. Design and implement an updated database schema that accurately reflects this structure.
3. Create or modify migration scripts following the drop-and-rebuild approach used in Task #16.
4. Update the data transformer to handle any integer timestamp fields, converting them to MySQL DATETIME strings.
5. Modify the import scripts to correctly parse and store all fields from the API response.
6. Update any related components (controllers, models, services) that interact with war status data.
7. Ensure backward compatibility where possible, or document breaking changes.
8. Add appropriate error handling for potential API response variations.
9. Create comprehensive documentation of the new schema and integration process.
10. Update any existing queries or reports that rely on the war status data.

The implementation should prioritize data integrity and performance, especially considering that war status data may be frequently accessed and updated.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this task should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test the data transformer to verify correct handling of integer timestamps to DATETIME conversions
   - Test the import scripts with mock API responses to ensure proper parsing
   - Test database models for correct field validation and relationships

2. Integration tests:
   - Test the full import process with sample API responses
   - Verify that all fields are correctly stored in the database
   - Test the retrieval of war status data through relevant endpoints

3. Regression tests:
   - Ensure existing functionality that depends on war status data continues to work
   - Verify that any reports or dashboards display correct information

4. Performance tests:
   - Measure import time for typical API responses
   - Test query performance for common war status data access patterns

5. Manual verification:
   - Compare the stored data with the raw API response to confirm accuracy
   - Verify the data is displayed correctly in the application UI

Document all test cases and results, including before/after comparisons of database structure and data representation. Include screenshots of the working integration in the documentation.
