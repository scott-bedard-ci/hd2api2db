# Task ID: 16
# Title: Task #16: Rebuild News API Integration to Match Actual API Response Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the database schema, import scripts, and related components to correctly handle the actual structure of the news API response, ensuring all fields are properly stored and retrieved.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive update to the news API integration to align with the actual API response structure:

1. Database Schema Updates:
   - Modify the news table schema to include all fields from the API response (id, published, type, tagIds, message, etc.)
   - Ensure appropriate data types for each field (e.g., timestamps for published, arrays for tagIds)
   - Add any necessary indexes for performance optimization
   - Create migration scripts for schema changes

2. Data Import/Fetch Script Updates:
   - Refactor the API client code to parse all fields from the news API response
   - Implement proper error handling for missing or malformed fields
   - Update the data storage logic to correctly map API response fields to database columns
   - Ensure proper handling of any special data types (arrays, JSON objects, etc.)

3. Data Wiping Logic:
   - Create or update truncation/wiping functionality specific to the news table
   - Ensure this logic is compatible with the CLI wipe command from Task #15
   - Add safeguards to prevent accidental data loss

4. Documentation:
   - Document the new database schema with field descriptions
   - Create a migration guide for future developers
   - Update API integration documentation to reflect the changes
   - Document any new functions or methods created

5. Implementation Approach:
   - Focus on correctness rather than preserving existing data
   - Implement changes in a feature branch
   - Follow existing project coding standards and patterns
   - After completing the news API integration, prepare to repeat the process for other endpoints

Note: This task is a prerequisite for similar updates to other API endpoints, so code should be structured to facilitate reuse where possible.

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy should verify all aspects of the updated news API integration:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the API client's ability to correctly parse different response formats
   - Test mapping functions that convert API responses to database models
   - Test error handling for edge cases (missing fields, null values, etc.)

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create tests that mock API responses and verify correct database storage
   - Test the full fetch-and-store pipeline with sample API responses
   - Verify that all fields are correctly stored and retrieved from the database

3. Database Tests:
   - Test schema migrations to ensure they run without errors
   - Verify that the database schema matches the expected structure
   - Test data wiping functionality to ensure it properly cleans the news table

4. Validation Tests:
   - Compare stored data against raw API responses to verify field-by-field accuracy
   - Test with a variety of real API responses to ensure robustness

5. Test Environment:
   - All tests must use the test database (following Task #14 policy)
   - Tests should include the database safety check from Task #13
   - Tests should clean up after themselves

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - All tests pass consistently
   - Database schema correctly reflects all fields from the API
   - Import scripts successfully store all data from sample API responses
   - Documentation is complete and accurate
   - Code review confirms adherence to project standards
