# Task ID: 21
# Title: Task #21: Rebuild Planet History API Integration to Match Actual API Response Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the database schema, import scripts, and related components to correctly handle the actual structure of the planet history API response, ensuring all fields are properly stored and retrieved.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive rebuild of the Planet History API integration to align with the actual API response structure. Key implementation steps include:

1. Analyze the actual Planet History API response structure to identify all fields, data types, and relationships.
   - Analysis complete: API response includes created_at (ISO timestamp), current_health (int), max_health (int), planet_index (int), player_count (int)

2. Update the database schema to accommodate the actual response structure:
   - Create a migration script (007_update_planet_history.sql) using ALTER TABLE statements to add the following columns:
     * current_health (BIGINT)
     * max_health (BIGINT)
     * player_count (INT)
   - Ensure proper field types and constraints are defined
   - Add appropriate indexes for performance optimization
   - Migration script has been prepared and is ready for execution on both live and test databases

3. Update the data import scripts to:
   - Parse all fields from the API response correctly
   - Implement a transformer to handle data type conversions
   - Check for integer timestamp fields and convert them to MySQL DATETIME strings
   - Handle any nested data structures appropriately

4. Update related components:
   - Modify service layer methods that interact with Planet History data
   - Update repository/data access layer to reflect new schema
   - Adjust any controllers or endpoints that expose Planet History data

5. Update documentation:
   - Update API documentation to reflect new data structure
   - Document the database schema changes
   - Update any developer guides related to Planet History data

6. Ensure backward compatibility where possible, or document breaking changes clearly.

7. Follow the established patterns from previous API integration rebuilds (Tasks 18-20) for consistency across the codebase.

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy should verify that the Planet History API integration correctly handles the actual API response structure:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the transformer functions to ensure proper conversion of integer timestamps to MySQL DATETIME strings
   - Test data mapping functions to verify all fields are correctly mapped (created_at, current_health, max_health, planet_index, player_count)
   - Test repository methods for CRUD operations on the updated schema

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create tests with mock API responses that match the actual structure
   - Verify the entire import process works end-to-end
   - Test that all fields are correctly stored in the database
   - Verify that retrieved data maintains integrity and matches the original API data

3. Database Tests:
   - Verify the migration script (007_update_planet_history.sql) executes without errors on both live and test databases
   - Confirm the schema matches the expected structure after migration
   - Test queries against the new schema for performance
   - Verify that the new columns (current_health, max_health, player_count) are properly added and can store the expected data types

4. API Tests:
   - Test any endpoints that expose Planet History data
   - Verify the response format matches documentation
   - Test edge cases like missing fields or null values

5. Manual Testing:
   - Perform a complete import of real Planet History data
   - Verify data integrity through admin interface or reporting tools
   - Check for any performance issues with large datasets

6. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure other system components that depend on Planet History data continue to function correctly
   - Verify that the changes don't negatively impact related features

Document all test results and any issues encountered during testing.
