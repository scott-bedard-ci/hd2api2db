# Task ID: 25
# Title: Task #25: Implement Chaos Bot for Helldivers 2 API-to-DB Pipeline Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a configurable Chaos Bot that simulates and injects various production issues into the Helldivers 2 API-to-DB pipeline to test its robustness, error handling, and recovery capabilities.
# Details:
The Chaos Bot should be implemented as a separate module that can intercept and modify API responses or database operations in the pipeline. Key implementation details include:

1. Design fault injection scenarios:
   - API timeouts and connection failures
   - Malformed JSON responses (invalid structure, missing fields, unexpected types)
   - Partial data responses
   - Rate limiting simulation
   - DB connection drops and timeouts
   - Foreign key violations (missing references)
   - Duplicate data entries
   - Schema validation failures
   - Intermittent failures (random timing)

2. Implementation requirements:
   - Create a modular architecture allowing easy addition of new fault types
   - Implement configuration system via YAML/JSON files to control:
     - Types of faults to inject
     - Frequency/probability of each fault
     - Timing parameters (duration, intervals)
     - Severity levels
   - Develop hooks/interception points in the pipeline for fault injection
   - Implement comprehensive logging of all injected faults with timestamps
   - Create a summary report generator showing:
     - Total faults injected by type
     - Pipeline response to each fault (recovery, failure, etc.)
     - Performance impact metrics
     - Recommendations for improvements

3. Integration with existing pipeline:
   - Modify the pipeline to allow optional Chaos Bot integration
   - Ensure the bot can be enabled/disabled via configuration
   - Add command-line flags for chaos testing mode
   - Implement safeguards to prevent accidental use in production

4. Documentation:
   - Create detailed usage documentation
   - Document all available fault types and configuration options
   - Provide examples of common testing scenarios
   - Include troubleshooting guide for the Chaos Bot itself

# Test Strategy:
Testing the Chaos Bot implementation should follow these steps:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test each fault injection mechanism in isolation
   - Verify configuration parsing and validation
   - Test logging functionality and report generation
   - Ensure proper cleanup after fault injection

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the Chaos Bot with a staging/test version of the pipeline
   - Verify that each fault type can be properly injected
   - Confirm that the pipeline's error handling responds appropriately
   - Test that the bot correctly logs all activities

3. Validation Testing:
   - Create specific test scenarios that combine multiple fault types
   - Verify that the summary reports accurately reflect injected faults
   - Test edge cases (extremely high fault rates, long-duration faults)
   - Ensure the bot can be safely disabled/enabled without affecting normal operation

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure the overhead introduced by the Chaos Bot when enabled
   - Verify that the bot itself doesn't become a bottleneck
   - Test with various configuration settings to ensure scalability

5. Acceptance Criteria:
   - All planned fault types can be successfully injected
   - The bot produces accurate logs and summary reports
   - The pipeline's error handling can be effectively evaluated
   - Configuration changes take effect without requiring restarts
   - Documentation is comprehensive and includes examples
   - The bot can be completely disabled with no residual effects on the pipeline

6. Manual Testing:
   - Conduct a "chaos engineering session" where team members use the bot to identify potential weaknesses in the pipeline
   - Document any unexpected behaviors or failures discovered

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement core Chaos Bot architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational architecture for the Chaos Bot, including the module structure, configuration system, and basic interception framework.
### Details:
Implement a modular architecture with: 1) A core Bot class that manages fault injection, 2) A configuration parser for YAML/JSON files, 3) An interception framework with hooks for API and DB operations, 4) A fault registry system for registering different fault types, and 5) Basic command-line interface for enabling/disabling the bot. The configuration system should support specifying fault types, frequencies, timing parameters, and severity levels.

## 2. Implement fault injection scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Develop the specific fault injection modules for all required scenarios, including API faults, data corruption, and database issues.
### Details:
Create separate fault injector classes for each fault category: 1) NetworkFaultInjector for API timeouts and connection failures, 2) DataFaultInjector for malformed JSON and partial responses, 3) RateLimitInjector for simulating API rate limits, 4) DatabaseFaultInjector for DB connection issues and query failures, 5) ValidationFaultInjector for schema and foreign key violations. Each injector should implement a common interface defined in the core architecture and include configuration for probability, duration, and severity.

## 3. Integrate Chaos Bot with the Helldivers 2 API-to-DB pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Modify the existing pipeline to support Chaos Bot integration, adding interception points and safety mechanisms.
### Details:
1) Identify and implement interception points in the API client, data transformation layer, and database access components, 2) Add configuration flags to enable/disable Chaos Bot at runtime, 3) Implement environment detection to prevent accidental use in production, 4) Create a pipeline wrapper that can route operations through the Chaos Bot when enabled, 5) Add graceful degradation mechanisms to ensure the pipeline can recover from injected faults when possible.

## 4. Implement logging and reporting system [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive logging of injected faults and a reporting system to analyze pipeline resilience.
### Details:
1) Implement detailed logging of all fault injections including timestamp, fault type, severity, and duration, 2) Create a metrics collection system to track pipeline response times and recovery rates, 3) Develop a summary report generator that shows statistics on injected faults, pipeline responses, and performance impacts, 4) Add visualization capabilities for fault frequency and impact, 5) Implement recommendations engine that suggests pipeline improvements based on observed failures.

## 5. Create documentation and usage examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation for the Chaos Bot, including usage guides, configuration options, and troubleshooting information.
### Details:
1) Create detailed API documentation for all Chaos Bot components, 2) Write a user guide explaining configuration options and command-line flags, 3) Develop examples of common testing scenarios with sample configuration files, 4) Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues, 5) Document all available fault types with their parameters and expected impacts, 6) Include a section on interpreting reports and implementing recommended improvements.
