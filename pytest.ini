[pytest]
markers =
    complete: marks tests as full integration/orchestration (deselect with '-m "not complete"')
    fast: marks tests as fast unit/functional tests (default)
    no_db: marks tests that do not require DB setup/teardown (skips DB cleanup fixture)

# Usage:
#   pytest -m fast        # Run only fast (unit) tests
#   pytest -m complete    # Run only complete (integration) tests
#   pytest                # Run all tests
